Food Review App - Frontend

This is the frontend part of the Food Review App.

Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript 
- Connects to Node.js Backend API

How to Run Locally

1. Make sure the backend is running:
cd ../backend
npm install
npm run dev .  Serve the frontend:

Open frontend folder in VS Code.

Use Live Server extension or Python HTTP Server:
python3 -m http.server 8000
